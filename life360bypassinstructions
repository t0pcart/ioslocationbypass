Install Filza(if you do not have it)
Open filza and go to the directory /var/containers/Bundle/Application
Scroll down till you find Life360 folder(it should have a bunch of random letters and numbers but the app name will be in blue)
Open the folder, then open the Life360.app in the folder
Copy the Life360 executable(The executable is named "Life360")
Open NewTerm

run sudo chmod a-x LIFE360 (Replace LIFE360 with the path to the binary).
You can now use the main tool

After you are done with the main tool, and you need to restore location services, repeat steps 1-6 but follow this step instead of step 7:
run sudo chmod a+x LIFE360 (Replace LIFE360 with the path to the binary)
